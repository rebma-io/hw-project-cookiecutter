# KiCad Cookiecutter Template

This is a simple
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template
that will set up a directory for a KiCad project. It lets you choose a
few things, like number of layers, and will set things up the way I want
them to be set up. Right now, it uses a template that has my org's logo
on it.

Please feel free to fork this and adapt it to whatever it is you want as
your default.
