# KiCad Cookiecutter Template

This is a simple
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template
that will set up a directory for a KiCad project. It lets you choose a
few things, like number of layers (2, 4, 6, 8), and will set things up the
way I want them to be set up. Right now, it uses a template that has my 
org's logo on it.

To use it, you can just use it from the command line directly from
GitHub like this:

```
$ cookiecutter gh:rebma-io/hw-project-cookiecutter
```

Please feel free to fork this and adapt it to whatever it is you want as
your default.
