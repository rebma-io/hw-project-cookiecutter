# Datasheets

This directory contains all the datasheets for parts associated with 
the {{cookiecutter.project_name}} project. We use the following naming 
convention for all datasheets, in order to be consistent in a world where 
every manufacturer uses a different naming scheme:

> <_mfg-part-number_>-<_mfg-abbreviation_>-<_date-retrieved_>.<_file-format_>

For the date retrieved, use the format `YYYYMMDD`.

Note that we do not necessarily need to include every 
[jellybean part](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jellybean_part), unless 
there's some specific reason for it.
