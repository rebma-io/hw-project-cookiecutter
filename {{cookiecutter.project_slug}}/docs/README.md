# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the {{cookiecutter.project_name}} project.
This directory houses all the critical documents, from high-level design 
documents to detailed hardware considerations.

The documentation directory is broken down into 4 main sub-directories:

1. [Design](./design/README.md) - This folder is contains the overall 
   design documents such as project requirements, specifications, and 
   system architecture. It should also include goals and non-goals.
2. [Hardware](./hardware/README.md) - This folder contains detailed 
   documentation on the mechanical and electrical design.
3. [Software](./software/README.md) - This folder contains the code and 
   build infrastructure for all the software associated with the project.
   This includes tools, bootloaders, and firmware.
4. [Blog](updates/index.md) - This folder contains the ongoing narration
   of the project in the form of a blog. It's a good place to keep people
   interesting in the project up-to-date.

## Changelog

The [changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) is an important 
part of the documentation. It records the major changes between each project 
revision. It should contain:

- A list of all significant modifications, improvements, and bug fixes made 
  to the project in each version.
- A brief description of why the changes were necessary.
- The date of the changes.

This fits together with the [decision log](../design/README.md) in helping
people navigate the project. Thorough, updated, and accessible documentation
is crucial for a project's success.
