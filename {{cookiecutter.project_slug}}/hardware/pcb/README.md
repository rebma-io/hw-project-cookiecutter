# PCB

Keep PCB (KiCad) projects organized here. If you only intend to have a single
project, then you can keep it at this level, but if you intend to have, or
think you might have, multiple boards, you should create a project for each
board.

You can create a project using the KiCad cookiecutter template as well:

```
$ cookiecutter gh:rebma-io/kicad-cookiecutter
```

The `kicad-lib` directory is intended to hold all the KiCad symbol, footprint,
and other libraries.
