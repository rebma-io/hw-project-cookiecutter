# Wiring Information

[WireViz](https://github.com/wireviz/WireViz/) is a tool for easily
documenting cables, wiring harnesses and connector pinouts. It takes plain
text, YAML-formatted files as input and produces beautiful graphical
output (SVG, PNG, ...) thanks to GraphViz. It handles automatic BOM (Bill
of Materials) creation and has a lot of extra features.

This directory contains:

* `sample.yml` - An example of using WireViz to document a basic cable. 
  You can take this and use it as a base, or delete it.
