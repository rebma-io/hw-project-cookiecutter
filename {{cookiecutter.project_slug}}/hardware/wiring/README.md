# Wiring Information

[WireViz](https://github.com/wireviz/WireViz/) is a tool for easily
documenting cables, wiring harnesses and connector pinouts. It takes plain 
text, YAML-formatted files as input and produces beautiful graphical 
output (SVG, PNG, ...) thanks to GraphViz. It handles automatic BOM (Bill 
of Materials) creation and has a lot of extra features.
